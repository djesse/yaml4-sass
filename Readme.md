# yaml4-sass

YAML4-Sass is the official Sass/Compass port of the CSS framework YAML, created and maintained by its developer Dirk Jesse.

YAML ist also availabe in a static CSS version, that can be downloaded at: <http://www.yaml.de>

## Recent Version
yaml4-sass: 4.1.0b

## Quick Start
* **compile once** `compass compile` starts a single run to compile sass/scss files to CSS.
* **edit** `compass watch` starts the watcher that recompiles your sass/scss files on every change.

## Overview
The Sass port is built in a way that allows you to create a fully customized version of YAML's framework files.

The Sass port creates all CSS files in the following folders:

* demos/css/
* docs/assets/css/
* yaml/

Please keep in mind, that the /yaml/ folder also contains serveral JavaScript files. So, don't delete this folder, as it's content is not completely generated by Sass.

## Docs
Download or clone this project and open file "docs/index.html" in your browser.

pleased with YAML, perhaps you would like to take a look at my Amazon wish list?
